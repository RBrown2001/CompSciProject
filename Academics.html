		<p>My major has changed a lot over the years. It began as wanting to major in art to go into graphic design.<br>
		It then changed briefly to theater my high school senior year due to me taking a theater class which led to me wanting to do theater tech.<br>
		Lastly, it changed to criminal justice once I took a forensics class that same year. We learned a lot about the justice system, forensics, and we<br>
		even did a few case studies! It facinated me a lot and I figured it would pay a bit more than graphic design. Now here I am, pursuing my bachelor's of<br>
		to eventually go into crime scene investigation!</p>
