	<p>Hello again! Glad to see you decided to check out the other pages!<br>
	I'll be honest with you, I'm not the best at introductions.<br>
	I'm just a 22 year old tired college student. I'm non binary and<br>
	I use they/them pronouns! I live with 3 roommates in a house I inhereted<br>
	from my father. My father died in May of 1014 and my mother passed in November of 2017.<br>
	So it's just me left here in Columbus. I have a sister in Alabama and another in Maryland.<br>
	Anyway, sorry that got kinda dreary. Unfortunately, my life is just like that. I've learned to cope.<br>
	As for other things, I've lived in Columbus for nearly 15 years now. I moved to Georgia when I was 9.<br>
	</p>

	<h2>Hobbies and Other Nonsense</h2>
	<p>Of course, as a nerdy adult, I have many hobbies. I love music with my favorite genre being indie!<br>
	My favorite band is Mother Mother and my favorite artist is Neito Han! I also love video games and have since<br>
	I was a child. I had a Wii and a Nintendo DS growing up but I've since moved onto XBOX, PlayStation, a Nintendo Switch,<br>
	and I've even been dipping my toes into PC gaming! My favorite franchise is the Legend of Zelda. The first game I played was<br>
	Breath of the Wild and I've since played many other Zelda games, including the classics like Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword!<br>
	I also love cartoons with my all time favorite being Steven Universe! I fell in love with the show when it first released and watched<br>
	to the very end. Other honorable mentions include Gravity Falls, The Owl House, and Bee and Puppycat! And lastly, I am a D&D player!<br>
	I've been playing for about 4 years now with multiple groups. D&D, or dungeons and dragons, is a table top roleplaying game. I currently<br>
	play with my closest friends. There are currently 8 players including the dungeon master. I'm currently playing a tiefling warlock named Astrid!</p>
